### 1. **AI-Powered Task Prioritization**

- **Concept:** Add a feature that uses AI to automatically prioritize tasks based on due dates, keywords (e.g., "urgent," "important"), and user-defined rules.
- **Benefit:** Saves users time from manually sorting tasks and helps them focus on what matters most.

### 2. **Recurring Tasks [DONE]**

- **Concept:** Allow users to set tasks to repeat on a schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Benefit:** Automates the creation of routine tasks, reducing manual entry and ensuring nothing is forgotten.

### 3. **Natural Language Dates**

- **Concept:** Let users type due dates in natural language (e.g., "tomorrow," "next Friday," "in 2 weeks"), and have the system parse it into a formal date.
- **Benefit:** Speeds up task creation and makes the interface more intuitive.

### 4. **Command Palette [DONE]**

- **Concept:** Implement a command palette (often opened with `Ctrl/Cmd + K`) that allows users to quickly access any action in the app—like creating a task, switching views, or opening settings—by typing its name.
- **Benefit:** A massive productivity booster for power users who prefer keyboard-driven workflows.
- **Status:** ✅ Completed with custom vertical slide animation, keyboard navigation, and comprehensive command coverage.

### 5. **Integrations with Other Apps**

- **Concept:** Connect KEPH with other tools like calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook), note-taking apps (Notion, Evernote), or communication platforms (Slack, Teams).
- **Benefit:** Creates a centralized hub for all of a user's tasks and information, reducing context switching.

### 6. **Gamification and Progress Tracking**

- **Concept:** Add elements like streaks for completing daily goals, achievement badges for milestones, and more detailed analytics on productivity trends.
- **Benefit:** Increases user engagement and motivation by making task management more rewarding.

### 7. **Enhanced Search with Filters**

- **Concept:** Augment the existing search to include filters for due date ranges, creation dates, tasks with/without notes, etc.
- **Benefit:** Allows users to find specific tasks much faster, especially as their task list grows.

### 8. **Time Blocking / Pomodoro Timer**

- **Concept:** Integrate a timer to help users focus on a single task for a set period (e.g., 25 minutes), a technique known as the Pomodoro Technique.
- **Benefit:** Improves focus and helps users break down large tasks into manageable work sessions.

Which of these ideas sounds most interesting to you? We could start by implementing one of the more straightforward but high-impact features, like **Recurring Tasks** or **Natural Language Dates**.
