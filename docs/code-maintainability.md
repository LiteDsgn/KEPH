## Code Quality & Maintainability Suggestions
Based on the codebase analysis, here are recommendations to enhance your KEPH application:

### 1. Error Handling & Resilience
- Add error boundaries in React components to gracefully handle runtime errors
- Implement retry logic for Supabase operations with exponential backoff
- Add loading states and error messages for better user experience during network issues
### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Implement React.memo for TaskItem components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use useMemo for expensive task filtering operations
- Add virtual scrolling for large task lists to improve performance
- Optimize bundle size by implementing code splitting for non-critical features
### 3. Type Safety Improvements
- Add stricter TypeScript configs with strict: true and noImplicitAny: true
- Create custom hooks with proper typing for common operations
- Use discriminated unions for task status to prevent invalid state combinations
### 4. Testing Strategy
- Add unit tests for task management hooks using Jest and React Testing Library
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- Add E2E tests using Playwright for complete user journeys
### 5. Code Organization
- Extract business logic into separate service layers
- Create custom hooks for complex state management
- Implement a consistent naming convention across components and files
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and hooks
### 6. Security Enhancements
- Implement input validation using libraries like Zod
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use environment variables for all configuration values
### 7. Monitoring & Analytics
- Add error tracking with services like Sentry
- Implement performance monitoring to track Core Web Vitals
- Add user analytics to understand feature usage patterns
### 8. Development Workflow
- Set up pre-commit hooks with Husky for code quality checks
- Add automated dependency updates with Dependabot
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Use conventional commits for better change tracking
